# PythonLab
- This is a practice place for newbies like me to note how to write Python Language.

# Notes
## A proper comment style of Python code
- Comments that are separated by a blank line should be used to indicate different sections within a function. For example, you may have a comment describing the purpose of the function, followed by a blank line, followed by comments describing different parts of the function's implementation.
- However, if you have a comment that directly precedes a function definition and there are no blank lines between them, the comment is considered part of the function's documentation, and the two blank lines guideline does not apply. In this case, the comment serves as a docstring, which provides a concise description of what the function does.
